title: About me
subtitle: A mathematician in the field of Cyber Security
---

My nickname is **TekCookie75** and I am a mathematician who went to the dark side. Some years ago I left the ideal world of mathematics to get familiar with various topics of computer science. I learned about operating systems, memory management, basic offensive security operations and cyber defense. However, what intrigues me the most is the art of DFIR. Nevertheless I am a junior in this area and will keep learning the entire life.

What else do you need to know?

### The Story of this Blog

The idea of this blog is to casually write on topics related to computer science in general and cyber security specifically. Future posts may include topics like
- General Guides
- Write-Ups on CTFs, both offensive and defensive
- Programing ideas
- and all the stuff I want to write about. :-)
