My nickname is TekCookie and I am a mathematician and security analyst from germany. I love to understand complex things taking the way down the rabbit hole. On this blog I will, whenever time permits, post on topics like

- Malware Analysis using static code analysis, i.e., reverse engineering
- Identity related topics like Active Directory, and EntraID
- Topics targeting cloud environments from home-hosted kubernetes to AWS and Azure
- Whatever I am motivated to write on. :-)


### My story

I started my career with theoretical mathematic at university. After completing my bachelor and master degree I decided to make Phd. Live proved me that mathematics is a solid foundation to continue with, however without an application it is hard to get a job. Hence, I made the move to the exiting field of cyber security. Fisrst in a very theoretical role as a lecture on cyber security studies program. Later, I decoded to get some hands-on expierence. After completing the Offensive Security PEN-200 course, the SANS FOR 504, FOR 508 and FOR 610, i now found my compfort zone in the daily work in the field of cyber security. During my day to day job, I keep up to date on current topics, keep learning, and implementing detection rules, as well as working on the alerts they produce.


### My Blog

So, this is just another blog on cyber security with infrequent posts, right? - Right! It is. There are many good resources on the internet to learn cyber security and this blog targets just to make a little contribution to this community. There is no sake for completness or correctness in neither way, however I will give my best to make this blog a hopefully useful resource.
