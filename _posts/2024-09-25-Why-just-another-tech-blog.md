# Why (just) another Tech-Blog?

During the last decades humanity expierenced a significat growth in technology. "Buzzwords" like *AI*, *Cyber* and *Big Data* became part of our natural language and found a place in our day to day life. With the increasing access to relatively cheap server equipment, the falling prices of hosting services, and the general information available on the internet, nearly any person can start a blog nowadays. Indeed people doing this and so there is no surprise about the countless blogs and personal pages available on the internet. By starting [TekCookie75`s Blog](https://blog.tekcookie75.net) I became just one of these people. So the fundamental question is ***Why (just) another Tech-Blog?*** 

The simple answer to this question would be that I just can do it, however in this post I want to shortly share some thoughts I had when deciding to start this blog.

When I had my first contact with computer science, the single source of truth were books. We did not had internet nor was it as present as nowadays. So whenever I wanted to learn something, I had to find the right book and read through it. While this is an amazing experience I can totally recommend to anyone, it can become a daunting task as well. Books usually does not provide full-text search capabilites nor we have the space in our rooms to store all the relevant ones. So nowadays it is not uncommon to put any topic of our interest into our favorite search engine or ask the personal AI assistance of our choice for the solution. An amazing opportunities in my opinion, however if we think about it in more detail we will notice that all these wonderful solutions were provided by human intelligence in the end. So the AI assistents and search engines were human made, and the knowledge provided is human made. Anyways I think it is never really a single person changing the world! - But together we can! We can learn from each other and share our knowledge. Cumulating information and knowledge over the entire planet, we can become a very smart entity. So, in my perspective, the internet and all the available blogs can contribute exactly in becoming this smart entity, and I want to be a part of it, too! I want to learn from other information available, bring in my own perspective, and mulitply it by publishing it in form of a new blog post on [TekCookie75`s Blog](https://blog.tekcookie75.net).

So to sum up this short post and answer the intial question let me wrap up the reasons I created this blog. First of all I wanted to share valuable knowledge with the crowd helped me so often, when I had technical issues. Also I belive in the strength of crowdsourced intelligence. In my opinion, every small information published on the internet could be valuable as long as it is correct and help someone. Thus, it is no wounder that this blog tries to be a *quality over quantity* approach. I will try to put my best efforts into each post published. Second, for the sake of egoism, I will publish here for my own selfish mind. During the last years I worked in the area of computer science I noticed that I am very good in forgetting. So, to somehow limit my obliviousness, and remind my on the projects I did in the past, this blog is also used as personal documentation site. Finally, the writing of each of the upcoming posts will motivate me to think over each of my projects again and again contributing to their continual improvement. Thus, I will be enabled to monitor on my learnings and improve my home lab and DFIR skills step by step.

From this blog, you can expect various posts covering a wide area of topics. While I will try to keep the focus on *Digital Forensics and Incidence Response* and my *Home Lab* setup, I will casually write about any topic which comes into my mind. 

So be excited about the first posts released! :-)
