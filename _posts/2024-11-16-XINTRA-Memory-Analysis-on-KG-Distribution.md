# Lab Description

In this blog post I will deal with a very beginner friendly lab created by [13CubedDFIR](https://training.13cubed.com/). The lab was created for the amazing forensic and DFIR training and challenge platform [XINTRA](https://www.xintra.org/). To access the challenge, the paid subscription of XINTRA is required, which is in my opinion absolutely worth the price! 

During this lab you will learn how to use *MemProcFS* for memory analysis of two key systems. A basic workstation PC on which the attacker got initial access using a phishing mail, and the domain controller of the *KG Distribution* enterprise. 

You will learn how to perform memory forensics involving:

- C2 Analysis & Identification
- DLL Injection Techniques
- Persistence Techniques
- Exfiltration & Staging

Notice, that *13CubedDFIR* also does provide specialised training courses around the topics of DFIR, as well as providing a very informative YouTube channel. E.g., for more information on how to use *MemProcFS*, you may like to check out "13Cubed's Training course": [https://training.13cubed.com/investigating-windows-memory](https://training.13cubed.com/investigating-windows-memory).

Enough of the advertisement and let us dive into the adventure of volatile memory forensics.

# Scoping Notes

Last week, Patricia Bethel started her new job at KG Distribution. Amid the rush of HR and other on-boarding tasks, Patricia received an email from IT Support urging her to complete an important task. Trusting the source, Patricia carefully and diligently followed the instructions before continuing with her workday.

Several hours later, the Security Operations Center (SOC) helpdesk received an alert regarding unusual behaviour on one of the domain controllers. As part of their incident response protocol, the SOC remotely captured volatile evidence from this system, as well as from any other systems that had recently interacted with it in an atypical manner. Since it is now after normal business hours, the SOC has not yet been able to reach Patricia to question her about any activity on her system or to analyse the system itself. KG Distribution is also reluctant to take the domain controller offline and risk an outage, even after hours, until they are certain that the activity is indeed malicious.

As the Senior Security Engineer on call for after-hours alerts, it is now your responsibility to analyse the available evidence. Your task is to determine whether a security incident has occurred, and if so, identify the key details of the incident to decide if further action is necessary.

# Volatile Memory Analysis of the Workstation

We start our investigation by opening the provided memory image in *MemProcFS*. 

```Powershell
.\MemProcFS.exe -device "C:\Labs\Evidence\KGDistribution\Workstation\WORKSTATION.vmem" -forensic 1 -license-accept-elastic-license-2-0
```

![MemProcFS](https://github.com/TekCookie75/TekCookie75.github.io/tree/master/assets/img/_posts/2024-11-16-XINTRA-Memory-Analysis-on-KG-Distribution/XINTRA-MemProcFS.png)

Beside providing the plain memory image, we use the `forensic` option to run several forensic plugins like `malfind`, as well as accepting the `elasitc-license-2.0`. The later is required to enable the built-in `yara` rules in `MemProcFS`.

Right after mounting the volatile image as file system, we can browse to `M:\sys` to get an overview of general machine parameters.

- Hostname: `BLD2-RM202-14`
- Logged-on Users:  
	- User Principal Name:`patricia.bethel`
	- SID `S-1-5-21-2781234159-3908489525-3167879470-1128`
- Operating System: `Windows 10.0 (build 22621)`
- Network Interface:
	- IP Address: `192.168.8.12`
	- Gateway: `192.168.8.1`
	- DNS Servers: `1.1.1.1`, `8.8.8.8`
- Time Boot: `2024-08-11 16:24:02 UTC`

Additional parameters, may be extracted directly from the registry located at `M:\registry`. So, e.g., we can figure out the domain name, by browsing `M:\registry\HKLM\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Services\Tcpip\Parameters\domain` corresponding to the actual registry key `HKLM\SYSTEM\ControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters\domain`.

According to the scoping notes the user `patricia.bethel` was opening a malicious phishing mail on the machine. Checking the directories contained in `M:\name` we can see that their is *Thunderbird* listed among the processes present when the memory dump was created. Actually, there were four processes, with IDs `8056`, `8856`, `103040` and `12496`, present. We checked all of the directories and the handles opened, however we did not find any evidence of the mentioned mail. So we were on a dead-end here. According to hint from the platform, we should check for file activity. Considering the fact, that we were asked about a timestamp, our best option may becomes to check the *Timeline(s)* generated by *MemProcFS*. We browse to `M:\forensic\csv` and open the `timeline_all.csv` in *Timeline Explorer*. After some scrolling, we found reference to a file called `[Action Required] IT System Upgrade.eml`. The screenshot below will depict our findings.

![PhisingMail](https://github.com/TekCookie75/TekCookie75.github.io/tree/master/assets/img/_posts/2024-11-16-XINTRA-Memory-Analysis-on-KG-Distribution/XINTRA-Phising-Mail.png)

We can observe that at `2024-08-18 16:31:58`, there was a link file created in `Windows\Recent` directory of `patricia.bethel`. Hence, `2024-08-18 16:31:58` is the date of opening the phishing mail!

Once, we have the timestamp of initial compromise, it is a good idea to follow the timeline. So let us remove all filter and start scrolling down the timeline. Just a few minutes later, at `2024-08-18 16:32:50`, we notice a `NFTS` file created event. The user `patricia.bethel` downloaded a file called `dwagent.exe`. Researching on `dwagent.exe` we can get to know that the binary downloaded is part of **DWS Remote Control** software. Putting the purpose of this software in context with the timestamp close to the phishing mail, this tool was likely used by the attacker to remote control the machine. Later at `2024-08-18 16:33:13` we found evidence of creation of a *Prefetch* file, hence we now know for sure that the `dwagent.exe` was indeed executed.

Now, usually,. from `M:\forensic\csv\prefetch.csv` we can extract the timestamp of first execution. However, for some reason there is no *Prefetch* entry for `dwagent.exe`, which I could not explain! 

![dwagent-prefetch](https://github.com/TekCookie75/TekCookie75.github.io/tree/master/assets/img/_posts/2024-11-16-XINTRA-Memory-Analysis-on-KG-Distribution/XINTRA-prefetch-dwagent.png)

Anyway, we can assume that the `dwagent.exe` is still running due to the purpose of remote administration by the adversary. Hence, we can assume that we will still find `Creation Time` timestamps inside the process memory itself! We Open `M:\sys\proc\proc.txt` and search the process tree for `dwagent.exe`. Indeed we have a hit and get to know the execution-timestamp. It is `2024-08-18 16:33:30 UTC`.

![dwagent-execution](https://github.com/TekCookie75/TekCookie75.github.io/tree/master/assets/img/_posts/2024-11-16-XINTRA-Memory-Analysis-on-KG-Distribution/XINTRA-dwagent-execution.png)

Continue scrolling through the `timeline_all.csv` we observe some evidence of basic enumeration later around `2024-08-18 16:34:13`, where the attacker executed `whoami.exe`. Followed by execution of `query.exe` and `quser.exe` at `2024-08-18 16:34:51`. At `2024-08-18 16:35:48` the attacker continued enumeration using `net.exe`.

Next, at `2024-08-18 16:53:46` the attacker used `curl`, likely to download a file. Surrounding events may bring us to the conclusion that the attacker downloaded `OfficeUPgrade.exe`. It was shortly created afterwards and there seems to by a typo in place!  A minute later at `2024-08-18 16:54:46` we can spot evidence of execution of `OfficeUPgrade.exe` by the created prefetch file. Also, we observe that the registry was modified directly with the execution of the binary. According to the log, the key `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run` was touched. So likely, we have found a persistence mechanism.

To get a better picture of the entire workflow of the adversary, we may like to use the `timeline_all.csv`, but this time filtering on `*.pf` entities only. Thus, we obtain a nice list including execution of evidence and corresponding timestamps!

![XINTRA-Prefetch-all](https://github.com/TekCookie75/TekCookie75.github.io/tree/master/assets/img/_posts/2024-11-16-XINTRA-Memory-Analysis-on-KG-Distribution/XINTRA-Prefetch-all.png)

Removing again the filters and focusing on the entire activity, we spot beginning with `2024-08-18 17:27:43` some established connections to `64.23.144.215:8888` likely being related with adversarial activity due to the time correlation.

Let us go one step back, and focusing again on `OfficeUPgrade.exe`. If our assumption is right, and the mentioned binary is indeed malware, likely  the `findevil` plugin will have more information for us. So let us open `M:\forensic\csv\findevil`. Indeed, we have several entries related to `OfficeUPgrade.exe`.

![OfficeUPgrade](https://github.com/TekCookie75/TekCookie75.github.io/tree/master/assets/img/_posts/2024-11-16-XINTRA-Memory-Analysis-on-KG-Distribution/XINTRA-OfficeUPgrade.png)

It looks like we have to deal with **Cobalt Strike** here. Also, we can identify a `PE_INJECT` type event in the `COFFLoader.x64.dll` module.

Finally, let us look around for any other file system activity may be related to the intrusion. Once again in `timeline_all.csv` we filter on Type `NTFS` and scroll through the filtered elements. At `2024-08-18 17:36:01` we spot the creation of a file named `\Users\temp.ps1`. For this script we do not find any entries in the `findevil` data. However, we are in the lucky situation to find the `temp.ps1` file on disk extracted from the memory by *MemProcFS*. We open `M:\forensic\ntfs\ntfs_files.txt` and search for `temp.ps1`. We got a positive hit. The actual `temp.ps1` will be located at `M:\forensic\ntfs\1\Users`. The scripts contents is printed below:

```Powershell
[Reflection.Assembly]::Load([IO.File]::ReadAllBytes("$pwd\CMSTP-UAC-Bypass.dll"))
[CMSTPBypass]::Execute("C:\OfficeUPgrade.exe")
```

Examining the script, we notice reflective loading of the `CMSTP-UAC-Bypass.dll` into the `OfficeUPgrade.exe`. While  *MemProcFS* was not able to reconstruct this `DLL` file, the actual `OfficeUPgrade.exe` was reconstructed and is located in the `\forensic\ntds\1` directory. The executables `SHA-1` hash is `DA39A3EE5E6B4B0D3255BFEF95601890AFD80709`. Interestingly it was not detected as malicious by https://virustotal.com . Thus, we can expect that the threat actor was targeting us with a malware specially designed/modified for us. :-)

We now finally, may like to hand over the file to our reverse engineering and malware analysts department. Anyway, let us wrap up with the examination of the workstation and continue to check out the volatile memory of the domain controller provided as well.

# Analysing the Domain Controllers volatile memory

Before investigating the domain controller, let us shortly discuss the possible pivot points we may like to use to start our examination. From the analysis of the workstation, we already have some ideas about the threat actors tradecraft.

- `OfficeUPgrade.exe` or similar application names with minor misspelling in place.
- The expected date of intrusion will be the `2024-08-18`; likely after `5:00 PM`.
- The attacker used `dwagent.exe` for remote access, may also in place on the domain controller.
- The IP address `64.23.144.215` may serves as a good indicator of compromise as well.

We we check all of these indicators, we will likely not find any exact match but observe some similarities. There is indeed a connection to the IP address `64.23.144.215` in the logs, and we will find the keyword `officeupgrade` on the system as well. Anyway, finding these events may be daunting and time consuming. So let us take a different road. Assume for a moment we did not have found any similar. How would you start the investigation? Likely you would take a look at the list of running processes to check if there is any suspicious.

If we carefully read over the list of running processes, we will find a process running named `rGARTERny.exe` on `PID 4544`. The name looks very uncommon and suspicious. Checking the timeline, we see that the process was created at `2024-08-18 17:47:05` and started from the `\Windows\Temp` directory. Creation time and file location both fit into our adversaries behaviour! According to the process tree from `M:\sys\proc`, the parent process is `services.exe`. This indicates that the malware has installed a service in order to achieve persistence. So, we have our initial pivot point to start our analysis of the domain controller.

Let us investigate the `services.csv`, searching for `rGARTERny` first.

![rGARTERny-service](https://github.com/TekCookie75/TekCookie75.github.io/tree/master/assets/img/_posts/2024-11-16-XINTRA-Memory-Analysis-on-KG-Distribution/XINTRA-rGARTNERny-service-2.png)

We immediately spot the installed service called `officeupgradeservice`, fitting well into the picture of attackers trade-craft. Now, we can certain that this binary is malicious!

Notice, that the malicious binary is still present on disk. We can browse `M:\forensic\files\ROOT\Windows\Temp` to obtain a sample of `rGARTERny.exe` reconstructed from memory. Now, in theory we can hand it over to the reverse engineering and malware analysis department, however having a memory dump there are some other things we may like to do before. Inside the directory `M:\pid\4544\minidump` *MemProcFS* provides us a complete dump of the process executions memory. Since the memory snapshot was taken in runtime, all the contained code and strings are likely de-obfuscated! Thus, a perfect situation to mount static analysis on the dump. We let run `strings` against the dumped process memory.

Inside the memory dump there are several interesting artefacts. To just highlight some of them, you will find a screenshot of a certificate included in process memory below.

![rGARTERny-dump-1](https://github.com/TekCookie75/TekCookie75.github.io/tree/master/assets/img/_posts/2024-11-16-XINTRA-Memory-Analysis-on-KG-Distribution/XINTRA-rGARTERny-dump.png)

Even more interesting there is even a private key, we were able to dump from the memory.

![rGARTERny-dump-2](https://github.com/TekCookie75/TekCookie75.github.io/tree/master/assets/img/_posts/2024-11-16-XINTRA-Memory-Analysis-on-KG-Distribution/XINTRA-rGARTERny-dump-2.png)

This private key is probably used to secure the communication channel with the attacker. Finally, we find a reverence to a persistence tool-kit named **SharPersist**.

![rGARTERny-dump-3](https://github.com/TekCookie75/TekCookie75.github.io/tree/master/assets/img/_posts/2024-11-16-XINTRA-Memory-Analysis-on-KG-Distribution/XINTRA-rGARTERny-dump-3.png)

So we can see, just from a simple `string` command executed on a memory snapshot we can obtain so much information, even without the least knowledge of complex reverse engineering! Anyway, leaving the path of technical deep dive, let us focus again on the process tree and examine parental relations of `rGARTERny.exe` to better understand how the malware was executed and what it did on the machine.

The child process of `rGRATERny.exe` is `powershell.exe` with `PID 2404`. The actual command-line executed is `C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe -NoExit -Command [Console]::OutputEncoding=[Text.UTF8Encoding]::UTF8`.  Let us inspect this `powershell` process in more detail. We start by opening the `handles.txt` to see with which files / registry keys the process interacted. We immediately see ` \HarddiskVolume3\Users\Administrator\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup` directory contained among them, a typical directory touched when dealing with persistence. Browsing the `M:\forensic\files\ROOT\Users\Administrator\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup` directory, we will find a `OfficeUPgrade.exe`. The files `SHA-1` hash is `FE4349DF84249FC96E75B84A028EF25C2876669B`. The hash does not match with the malware samples found on the workstation! Also https://virustotal.com does not yield any match.

Next, let us see what the `findevil` plugin is reporting about the found samples. The built-in `yara` scans indicate `Multi_Trojan_Sliver_*`.  **Sliver** is a common command and control framework often used by penetration testers. 

When dealing with command and control frameworks it is always good to assume some data exfiltration activity present on the machine as well. So let us hunt for any of them. Usually, when the adversary compromised the domain controller, the first thing done is to dump credentials required to during the high-privilege lateral movement phase. To this end, three files are of special interest, the `SAM`, the `SYSTEM` and the `NTDS.dit` files. So let us open the `timeline_ntfs.csv` from the `forensic\csv` folder generated by *MemProcFS*. We sort the columns by time and scroll down to the time of expected intrusion. Next, we look for any suspicious file access to these files.

Indeed, at `2024-08-18 18:04:56`, we observe a uncommon access to the `ntds.dit` and `SYSTEM` hive, both required by the attacker in order to obtain all the domain users password hashes. The relevant events are highlighted in the screenshot below.

![data-exfiltration](https://github.com/TekCookie75/TekCookie75.github.io/tree/master/assets/img/_posts/2024-11-16-XINTRA-Memory-Analysis-on-KG-Distribution/XINTRA-data-exfiltration.png)

So from this point onward, we have to assume a complete breach of the domain. The threat actor certainly obtained domain users credentials may now be mounted in the context of pass-the-hash attacks or even using usual authentication assuming the adversary was able to crack some of the passwords at least.

# Wrapping up with KG Distribution

Patricia Bethel a new employee at KG Distribution opened a phishing mail with subject `[Action Required] IT System Upgrade` on  `2024-08-18 16:31:58` yielding a compromise of her local workstation. The threat actor was able to implant remote control capabilities using **DWS Remote Control** software. Once established the initial foothold, the attacker did basic enumeration and persisted on the machine using the registry Autorun keys. The implanted malware (`OfficeUPgrade.exe`) is of **Cobalt Strike** type.

Once, the threat actor fully compromised the client of Patricia Bethel lateral movement to the domain controller occurred. A new service named `officeupgradeservice` was created starting `rGARTERny.exe` from the Windows temporary directory. From the `rGARTERny.exe` process memory we were able to extract certificate and private key likely utilized by the attacker to secure communication channels. The used command and control framework was **Sliver**. The implanted tool-chain was used to exfiltrate the `NTDS.dit` and `SYSTEM` hive from the domain controller. So the threat actor achieved domain dominance and certainly obtained all password hashes / credentials from the `KGDISTRIBUTION` domain.
